simpleFoam
Laminar Flow
velocity inlet, Pressure outlet
* Calculates the pressure at the inlet with specified velocity*

Basic Requirements
 - p and U in 0 folder
 - transport and turbulence properties in constant folder
 - fvSchemes, fvSolution, controlDict, decomposeParDict in system folder



Water with constant properties 
Pipe length = 2m, Pipe diameter = 0.2m



Notable Features of this case
  - Can calculate pressure drop using Hagen Pousielle Law
  - includes topoSetDict for an example
  - parallel run (4 cores) 


## MESH GENERATED IN FLUENT AND IMPORTED HERE
  - Mesh has solid region as well, simpleFoam only needs fluid region
  - Mesh has been manually changed to keep only the fluid region as per this tutorial
