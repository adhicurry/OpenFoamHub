Transient Combustion model with flow driven by buoyant effects in chimney. 

Both inlet and outlet are Pressure BCs (Ambient)- Flow arises due to buoyancy effects.
Radiation model is added. 
Temp dependant out-of-plane heat loss is included. 
Combustion in bottom creates a temperature gradeient, creating a flow.
