Obtain SS flow field

Openfoam2206

This Case (Chen/Try2/ColdFlow/SS_Setup)
chtMultiRegionSimpleFoam - Use to get initial cold flow field for later simulations.  
k-omegaSST model, SS Flow, 2nd Order Discretization 

3 Step Solution Strategy

THIS CASE IS STEP 1 (and 2 if you switch turbulence model to LRR)

Step 1: Setup SS coldflow case (air only @ 300K)
	potentialFoam, k-omegaSST model, 2nd Order Discretization
	Obtain converged fields (U, p, p_rgh, phi) + Reynolds Stress (R)

Step 2: Setup SS Reynolds Stress Model case - (Switch to LRR)
	Use converged fields from above, add Reynolds Stress Model. 
	Start with 1st order schemes, switch to 2nd order. 
	Get converged flow field with RSM model
    
Step 3: Start transient combustion with converged solution from above 
	Switch to transient solver	
	Introduce Species at inlet
